1: An API is an application that returns data to a browser or server.
The server is basically an intermediary that consumes an API, I.E.
communicates with the API to retrieve data, parse it, and emits it to
the browser which visualizes the data, or can process it through an
user interface.

2: When a user types into a browser google.com, a DNS browser looks up
the domain url and matches it to its IP address. The browser, with the
DNS as an intermediary, makes a request to the google.com server, who
then returns an HTML page (as well as other links) which renders the
webpage in the browser.

3: RESTful routes are necessary to process data in a streamlined,
standardized manner.For example, the POST method allows a user to
generate new data to be stored in the browser. The GET method allows
a user to retrieve data bits from a server/API. The PUT method allows
a user to mutate certain data bits (UPDATE data on the server). Finally
the DELETE method allows a user to remove data from the server.

4: An API key is usually a uniquely generated code that is optionally
required by some API developers in order for developer servers
to communicate with with their API data. API keys are not required by
all API services, but those that require them would like them to be
protected by developers accessing their APIs. Many APIs allow Developers
to only access their APIs via keys on the server side; denying AJAX
requests on the browser side.
